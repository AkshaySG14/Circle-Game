Circle-Game
===========

Simple memory game involving patterns.
Follow the circles was a game developed for android, and consists of players memorizing and then repeating randomly selected patterns
of circles. The game itself was developed on android studio, and uses no game engine to support itself. Thus, the code may be a little
verbose. Nevertheless, the code does function and should provide for a learning experience for aspiring android developers.
